# Computer-Graphics
* Rasterization algorithms in X11
* Scan Conversion and BilinearInterpolation with colors
* Created for Computer Graphics course
* main goal is to perform Scan conversion for any triangle. And color them using bilinear interpolation.
* Also it draws any polygon and multiple shapes as well. 
* Bilinear interpolation is done only for a single triangle. I might later enable it for multiple triangles as well, but not now.
* click with mouse to provide coordinates of the triangles (polygon)
* click c to complete the polygon ( connect first and last vertices
* press s to start scan conversion 
* press b to switch off/on Bilinear interpolation
* find in functions few other key bindings.
