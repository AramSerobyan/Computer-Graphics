# Computer-Graphics
# Rasterization algorithms in X11
# Scan Conversion and BilinearInterpolation of colors
# Created for Computer Graphics course
# main goal is to perform Scan conversion for any triangles. And color them.
# Also it draws any polygon and multiple too. 
# Bilinear interpolation is done only for single triangle. I might later enable it for multiple triangles as well, but not now.
# click with mouse to provide coordinates of the triangles (polygon)
# click c to complete the polygon ( connect first and last vertices
# press s to start conversion 
# press b to switch off/on Bilinear interpolation
# find in functions few other key bindings.
